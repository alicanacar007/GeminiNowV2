## üö® CRITICAL MISSING COMPONENTS

### 1. Content Script (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Purpose**: Interact with web pages, capture screenshots, detect form fields
- **Files needed**: `content.ts` or similar
- **Integration**: Must communicate with background script and extension popup

### 2. Screenshot Capture (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Purpose**: Capture page screenshots for AI analysis
- **Dependencies**: Content script, Chrome APIs

### 3. Gemini Computer Use API Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Purpose**: Analyze screenshots and detect form fields
- **Backend**: Needs integration with existing Gemini setup

### 4. Form Field Detection & Parsing (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Purpose**: Parse AI responses to identify form fields and actions
- **Integration**: Content script + backend

### 5. Action Executor (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Purpose**: Execute form filling actions based on AI instructions
- **Integration**: Content script

## üìä PROGRESS SUMMARY

- **Day 1 (Core Infrastructure)**: ‚úÖ 100% Complete
- **Day 2 (Visual AI & Form Filling)**: ‚ùå 0% Complete
- **Day 3 (Polish & Demo Prep)**: ‚ùå 0% Complete

**Overall Progress**: ~33% Complete (1 out of 3 days)

## üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. **Create content script** for page interaction
2. **Implement screenshot capture** functionality
3. **Integrate Gemini Computer Use API** for visual analysis
4. **Build form field detection** and parsing
5. **Create action executor** for form filling
6. **Test end-to-end flow** on simple forms

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT

- WebSocket connection testing needs completion
- Error handling could be more robust
- UI needs polish and loading states
- Production deployment not ready
- Demo preparation not started

## üìù NOTES

- The backend is well-structured and mostly complete
- The extension UI is functional but basic
- The core voice conversation flow works
- Missing the entire visual AI and form filling pipeline
- No content script means no page interaction capabilities
- No production deployment means no demo-ready system
